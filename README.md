# SteamOid2
```
<PackageReference Include="SteamOid2" Version="*" />
```

Library for integrating with Steam's Open-ID provider in .NET, as described here: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth#website.

Available for .NET 9.0

## Usage
```cs
using SteamOid2;
using SteamOid2.API;

// A DI constructor is also available using IConfiguration in the .NET and .NET Standard targets.
ISteamOid2Client client = new SteamOid2Client("http://localhost:8001/", "http://localhost:8001/openid/login");
```

* Redirect **user** to `client.GetLoginUri()`;

* The user will log in, then a request will be sent to the backend at the callback URI.

* Use `client.ParseIdReponse(uri)` to see if the returned Status is successful.

* Send a **POST** request to `client.GetAuthorizeUri(uri)` to ask Steam to confirm that the Steam ID provided was actually logged in to (from the backend).

* Use `client.CheckAuthorizationResponse(response)` to check that the response from the **POST** indicates a valid login session.

If you're seeing `Error` when you try to log in from Steam, make sure the realm domain name is the same as the callback domain name.

## Generating a Strong Name Key/Pair

For .NET 5+ assemblies, there is no benefit to strong-named assemblies. The runtime does not validate the signature, nor does it use the strong-name for assembly blinding.
